# Synthesize patterns

We need to build a patterns table and an agent to populate it.

Pattern
name
description
(timestamps)

The PatternFinder agent should identify interesting pattern in the member datasets.

The goal is to identify conceptual relationships that existing among the membership. This information will be source data for generating interesting questions that build on that info to ask in the future.
