Meeting Title: Profile optimizer agent development for White Rabbit community
Date: Nov 17

Transcript:

Me: Between different people. Creating or seeing patterns of things that people have in common to create cohorts different types of things we could do in the future. And then part of the reason that Cynthia is here is because we'd also talked about this idea of of having a means where she currently is the thin mother is doing these monthly interviews with people to find out what is working, what's not, what needs to be changed. Is there ways where people and their own time could interact with an agent to be able to to share more insights with the agent so that she can scale Cynthia different places. Had was that members don't have a completed profile and show if you go to the members' page. The keyword doesn't do anything right now. So keyword painless way. They have a mic or brings up an excellent point, which is the the toolset we want build in terms of, like, eliminating possible connections and opportunities is useless unless we have rich data Right. To monitor. Right. So there's sort of a we can't we can't have one without the other. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And you said there was three parts to it. Right? The data like, there are three different projects that we could do as a group, like the data, the actual, then the thing cohort agents and then the methodology for how we code together. With AI tools. Yeah. Whether we use Which is, like, making coding agents that could check stuff. Right? Or Yeah. Like, maybe start with a structure like that and adding to it See, because I took I took what he had said around, and I totally agree with you that, like, he had said we need to enrich it through agents, but also that in a world where we had certain features that were built out, it incentivizes people to put in their information. Right? It doesn't necessarily necessitate it having to be an interactive agent to pull that information in, But there's a value add of, like, hey. If you put your information in, you might be able to find more stuff because I was interested personally in was on the profile settings for the users being able to go and say, hey. Here's here's your LinkedIn profile Here's all this other stuff so we can have agents or tasks that go out, straight back, come back, and then add that here information to enrich. Right? What we're to So if I were to synthesize like, the end goal so it's nice to keep fill the profile. Keep when we done. But what do we want? How would you synthesize? To me, what I'm hearing is wanna build something that will illuminate connections that are invisible to us as people. We don't I don't know what TMIs really have in common creative. Maybe we do. We, you know, should be writing songs together or something I don't know. Right? But if an AI, etcetera, which conversation with with each of us it's gonna find us, but it's gonna be able to eliminate some of those connections that would otherwise not have those answers. It just takes too long long for all of to, you know, have coffee with everybody in this room. Or whatever, you know, figure out what we're doing. So so I know. Is this This is this is our theory. Eliminate my hypothesis. We have a hypothesis. That's good name for a coffee. Coffee. That was a good name for a lot It'll be kinda cool as the after having AI, analyze, and so on. Like, there's a little section at the bottom popped up and said, hey. These folks are in similar fields with the other. These folks working on similar projects. Click to connect. Or something like that. Yeah. Except there's no networking aspect to the back end of this yet. Right? Like Yeah. They the the way it's set up right now is, like, here's your profile. Like, and you can search other profiles But, like, Amy was saying, it's not it's not really great at like, the the search part of it, isn't it, like, not Yeah. You know, and how you do stuff. So So speaking of coffee, I almost feel like the the the profile fill out portion Let's just bring someone up for so let's take ninety seconds to do that. I'm feeling like it's sort of a and maybe an agent sent you an email and says, come and have a come have a problem. You know, you gotta force, like, has a discussion and says, hey. I think these are the things that we can add to your profile. Do you think? Boom. So it does an assessment of your profile status, a, Right? And then says this is where don't have anything or where your light Mhmm. And then it creates potential interview questions predicated on Yeah. The status of the state of your profile? Yeah. I wouldn't even say necessarily comes up with a list of questions, but just has a conversation with you with the intent with the objective of obtaining a ridge set of probiotic member so I I don't remember, and I just don't remember this process. Mhmm. But when a member signs up, like, what is the basic data that you will have immediately? So you need fill out the their profile. So all you have before they fill out their profile is your name and your email address. Can that be used to just go search the person, say, hey. I have created a potential profile. I found your credit score. You know something like this. Right. Yeah. You're on. I rushed it last month. Yeah. So I think, see, that maybe a different way to consider that would be if you you should should be some facet of opt in. Right? Okay. Like, so the opt in is more about like, the way the UI is currently set up, you can go in and you can add social link and add websites. Yeah. And so we should limit the research that it's doing to what you opt into. You know? But nothing else is an You just go query that database. And we'll say, hey. These only have next week. Percentage of data. For sure. Yeah. And then they can be okay. Let's ask questions about this. Know, you know, sentence for here and, like, you know, the entire novel of the good section. So let's ask them questions in this section. They'll I guess what I've the way I'm thinking about it is like, what is the version of this where the user has to do the absolute least amount of interaction? Because that's where I've been doing it. I hate doing your profiles. Yeah. Me too. Has, like, one seconds of it. So I would much rather be able to click a button and have AI go, oh, yeah. Found you. Here's what I would fill out for you in this this profile. Would you like to edit any of this Would you like to Or if you add to any of this. Yeah. Yeah. Or here's some areas where I think you could fill out more because we have you know, I whatever is going on with the the membership. And then I can just look at it and go, yeah, that's that's sounds about right. I don't know I need to this whole thing. Oh, alright. That's fine. And it's and, also, we have this rich data that's pulled from things that already exist. But I didn't have to do all those any work. So To me, that's the advantage, and I would absolutely do that. There's a there's a tension between these objectives. Like, I think one of the things that we want that we're a community based you know, we're all in here, you know, We live in the same town, and we're in the same community. We want it to reflect our ethics and values. In other words, we don't wanna do, like, a deep search Yeah. You know, on people to to fill that out probably. Because it's It could be LinkedIn just as like, would you like it to pull LinkedIn? That's the thing is we need to figure out what are our ethical boundaries that we wanna maintain while giving us the richest possible first draft of their profile suggestions. Yeah. Right? Well, often, obviously. I think we were talking last week about how everybody's a little different and how they like to provide information. Like, some people might wanna have a conversation with Cynthia or Thor have it be recorded. Some wanna have the conversation with the AI chatbot, and have that recorded. Some wanna actually type it into their profile. Like me, I probably will never give you any bit of information that you can search on on my profile. And my LinkedIn also won't have that. So it'll just be my name, and that's it. That's you'll ever get. That's better universal design too. Back in for different Brain patterns. Different users. So behavior. I'm actually surprised that they put the answers to my question on that website. Because nobody told me that that was going to happen. And I just I just I just typed in and I didn't process them very well. It was just putting them in because I was doing Oh, we passed judgment. Don't worry. So So, like, I personally, I don't like that. But Yeah. That's that's a good note. There should be there there should be some kind of I thought it was more internal for them to create. By the way, that's gonna be public. Yeah. If it was, like, log in based, sure, but it's not. But, anyway So, Rob, what's wrong? It's a relatively new website, so I I love that you have that feedback because I'm until the the time thing. Rob, would it would it help if you open up a browser on the side and then we saw what the profile data heels are? You can So I think that'll help give people a little bit more context to Another I think another piece of information where this some of this originally came from is that Cynthia was really considering, like, how to not monitor is not the right word because it feels intrusive, but how to support the members, like, the health of the membership, and just kind of have ways to check-in with people and see how they're doing and if they're feeling supported. And that we were talking about how everybody's still communicates that differently. It's you you were at a it's on the profile part is the the the key datasets. Okay. But that's isn't this the form for me or the last one? Or is it members? Two members. So it's in the internal part. So we can go let's go to meetings. Put your own stuff. Is the word okay? Branch. There it is. Yes. I love the French rock. That's, like, part of the where I think is what we need to figure out is a part of the the mission. Right? It's, like, what incentivizes people to wanna go back and to update their profiles because we're creating features or something. That makes it valuable right, to do that. Definitely So I'm just gonna remind you all that I'm right here. Yeah. So if you have any questions about this, I will gladly answer them. But I also want you to you know, express yourself freely about what's good, what's not so good, But I'm happy to answer any questions. So, like, why wouldn't if the profile is so important, why isn't that the first page after you create an account that shows everything empty? Like, please fill me up. I think, you know, all of this is sort of being discovered in real time. Know? And so yeah, the reason is probably because we're said that to anybody yet. So Cynthia just heard me say, why can't we see the profiles right up front when we, you know, more So okay. I'm just gonna give context of where all this came from. So the idea of building a member connected community where we all could find each other It felt like this was important, but at the same time, just like you said, I don't wanna I gave you my credit card. I don't wanna have to fill out a lot So they kept the question super, super basic. Mhmm. And a lot of people just skipped right past it. Said, I'm not gonna do that, including me. So I I absolutely feel you all about this. And for this to become a rich, connected community, eventually, we but it's not a requirement for membership. But eventually, everybody needs to level up to where Amy's at. Where we all know what you're up to so that we can find each other because the whole purpose of this being here in Downtown is for everybody to know what Mark is capable of and what he's passionate about so that they can find him and work with him and that we all do that. And so that's the purpose It's done a little sloppily right now just because there's so many moving parts. And that is why, again, by being part of such a great creative community, we can why I keep saying, talk to me in in my emails to y'all. So because every solution is is in this room, for sure. What what do you what problems do you think this could solve? I just wanna make sure we're building the right thing and not just doing something this question. Me let's go a couple of lies deeper. Why do we wanna eliminate the actions between Eliminate? The Eliminate. Yeah. Well, one reason was to build better events in cohorts. I think something that Thor brought up last week. Yeah. He said that Which kinda goes to the whole purpose of lifetime. Right. And then that enables the the identification of mutually shared goals and interests. And that that that could lead to different types of collaboration on future product. It's hard to know who's in this valley It's incredible pool of talent. And it's just everybody's working out of their home. And we don't know what each other's up to. And if we can shortcut that we can leverage up some incredible solutions that not just will impact our town, but could potentially protect. Impact. Okay. You just wanna apply deeper. Why do we want to build better events and cohorts? Why do we because it it drive well, different reasons. One, if they're already members, right, because it's already limited to the people that are here. So it drives more interaction think collaboration creates opportunities where I can find people that specialize on front end stuff I'm just an idea guy. Right? And I can learn. So there's, like, rising tide raises all ships type of scenarios here, particularly when it's with AI. Right? Like, the kind of the this Yeah. Opportunity. There's economic opportunities. Right? Like, I'm sitting next to somebody right now that could just be like, hey, man. Like, have you considered there's this meetup that's gonna have 25 startups that could use your product? Right? Like so I think there's a lot of unknowns that be drawn to a physical space together Yeah. Creates synergistic opportunities that are kinda unknown It's already happening, but it could be accelerated. Yeah. Feel like there's a Mostly, it's just because I think a lot of people were used to trying to be private from each other, Yeah. And this is a safe community, and we we're working every day to make it safer so that people can just let it shine so that we can find each other. That's it. Yeah. Hopefully, racing the boats is our favorite Just just real briefly that I I've felt coming here that there's a core belief that as we thrive individually, then our community will thrive, and then we'll have impact and it will lead towards, like, you know, sustainability and Better community. Yeah. Better community. Yeah. I didn't actually have a new Go ahead. Yeah. You have things to say face. And that's pretty strong. We could go deeper, you know, like, we're trying to build a thriving community. I think. When we really drill down into it. I that's where I my mind goes, my heart goes. Right? Like, you know, we're all in this you know Yeah. This journey of life. And we want our lives to be meaningful and purposeful and to engage with one another and you know, And so time we have Okay. Now you have something to say. So why planning. Sorry. Well, Well, just wanted like, I haven't looked at my profile since I made it. Why like, what what brings people back to it? The thing we're gonna build. I guess Well, I was actually just thinking that I feel like the possibility for really rich data goes way beyond the profile. Like, and you are good at this is why we have Ben here to help us with the data parsing because we don't have to show it all anywhere publicly on the data. It can just be accessible to the tools. So something that when when I speak about quite rabbit, I actually and I don't remember how exactly I say it and I feel like it's our way of fulfilling the narrative of the new techno Mhmm. How we're going to innovate and doing it in a responsible and ethical manner. Amen. I really like that Lee. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, boy, I mean, in narrative No. Say that exactly the same way again? Boy, in in narrative or how we're moving into the future new technology. And innovation. That kinda goes along with what I've I'm worried about on the opposite side of that. Which is the creator economy by AI is so individualistic now. Like, it's hyper hey, I can do everything with one thing. Mhmm. And I don't have to be around other people. Right? And you can create the illusion of fake AI friends so you don't ever really have talk to a real person. And so I think it's really, like, technology right now has it can risk the exacerbation of people isolating themselves. Being the illusion of being satiated. And so I think that there's another facet to this that's important, which is like, we know that community is important, because, like, you should get out, touch grass, share a smile, You know, you can't do that with a robot. You Leveraging technology to create a more convenient world. Yeah. Yes. And then on the narrative warfare side, just FYI, he who speaks first actually wins in narrative warfare. Right? It's because you set the tone. And then opponent the counter narrative is always on their heels. Because they're having to combat the representation you've made of reality. Mhmm. And so it's important for us to actually try to set the narrative in the Rogue Valley resistance, right, of like, hey. This is how we see technology. Working. Here's how we can work responsibly. And be balanced with our needs and interests and ethically in terms of what types of data we wanna use and how we wanna create standard operating procedures for people being aware of what data they're surrendering and how it's gonna be used. For their benefit or to their detriment. Right? Mhmm. Whatever side of it is. So how many of you are collaborating with each other? In projects? Doing something. Yeah. Because my my question My question. Like, why why why aren't we collaborating? Why are we creating a process to create collaboration? But, like, there's only out of 11 people, there's only two there. Are actively collaborating. I I wouldn't I would say that's an fair point. But here's my question to you. What do you define collaboration as? Because for the last six weeks, I've come to this to learn from Rob and from everybody else here. And there's a time, like, four weeks ago, Annie and Mark and I sat around and we whiteboarded out ideas because he had a pain point for something he's working on at work. Mhmm. Right? So we collaborated on solving a problem Yeah. That we're not truly collaborated on. Right? But we're we're taking the time to learn. Right? This group is essentially collaborating in the sense that we're growing skills collective skills together. Right? Mhmm. Notice this, I'm not very heavy handed to double her. Talking about and what we're discussing and what we have to run today. Right? So that that's kind of the idea is that this is sort of a loose organization of growing together. Yeah. You know? Also, feel like we're kinda defining what collaborating on antibody Yes. Looks like. Mhmm. Which is Here. New for for us. Yeah. So I think this is this is where that develops, and I think we're hoping that we get more of that. And this tool kinda needs to answer that question. Because that question is asked and and towards us. Well, why aren't people collaborating parts? Because well, people don't know We don't know to engage with each of our fabrics. this person's opinion of scoop, and you guys should talk in that Well, that that's what I'm kinda skeptical. Mhmm. What's that? I think I think we need to set an example. Right? It's like, it would be quick. It's like, oh, this project came out of white rabbit led by Annie, Benjamin, and Amy Right? And that it happened because we know each other. We collaborated. Otherwise, we're we're talking about like, what can we do for each other or where is the person that can do the thing that I need And we're we're all right here. Right? It's just a Okay. Right? That's kind of the thing that I'm like I'm not I'm not criticizing Okay. I I think you're right. I I know. Think you're right. But priority being here for for six weeks that I've come, Every week, it was something different. Mhmm. And then last week, we had this conversation where we're like, hey. Let's actually fucking do something together. Mhmm. And then Thor was here. He hadn't here before, and we're like, well, what can we do? And we're like, well, fuck it. Let's do something we can open source that we get back to White Rabbit. Yeah. And so that so just so you know, like, what you're talking about is literally kind of the irritation that we all had around not irritation is not the right word, but it was a pain point that we were like, hey. Let's figure out how to work. Like, for me, I've never worked in a group, right, of making a project. I worked with so I'm excited about it on the facet of, like, how do you work in a group? How do I learn how to commit stuff to get? Yeah. Right? Yeah. And then have collaborate. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So there's, like, different processes that I think are super exciting besides Mhmm. The other part. I would like yeah. And I'd like to add, like, some internal wise up there too for our team. And, like, for me, that would be one of them. How do we work on AI? Projects collaboratively with a development team? Effectively. I can tell you. Like, it's a next full time job. It's a team of six, and we're struggling. You know? That's my laughing. You know? It's it's a journey. It's all new. So we are talking about seen too. Yeah. And, yeah, here Which is fun when we got to have talking with people that are in there and ask questions, you know, there's somebody that actually can give them an answer for as 99% of Yeah. That's great. Great. So so maybe quick poll Do we feel like we're headed in the right direction, or we feel like we're losing our MS way? Anybody feel like we're like, starting this project would be a two two sharp return from what we've been. Doing for the last two or three months. Put your hand up, Doug. Looks kinda more our is rapid integration type techniques. So, like, while doing all those customer stuff, and my my story writing is really think, important for bigger, more solid projects. So this group, I think Well Probably they lost in the weeds really easy. Nine. Yeah. We should I think that taking taking your ground if you get for us, you know, Yeah. It would be fun to pick something really hard so we all feel super challenged. You know? Because any we could all, like, go off and build something on our own, but there's, like like, you're seeing the collaborative effect here or something with agents. Like, would be hard? Or interesting? What the fuck? And what's one feature? Here in the room already. You wanna give this more? But maybe we pick the one feature. Like, you're saying that we wrap rapidly iterate on. Like, we've done in the past weeks. Yeah. So it sounds to me like, we wanna make sure we're still digging in. Mhmm. And and Bill and Scott are in weekly. We don't wanna talk a couple two hours about what we might build and might be That's what I'm hearing. Okay. Fair? Yeah. Okay. Does it make sense for us to pick a a chunk of of this maybe, this initial agent that wants to have a conversation with people together. Yeah. Yeah. Proposed by me. That's a good idea. So yeah. You have to, like, a chatbot? I'm just in the Yeah. I what it might suggest to add to your profile, and you can put it. So can we start collaborating? Is that what you were saying? GitHub something? No. I was just saying that he likes GitHub issues. So I was like, let's make a bunch of them. Have to get just dive in as moves fast and breaks it as your tray. But also having come from an agency and knowing that and I'm not saying that it's to talk to the client, understand your problem, and strategist to, you know, ask questions. I'm more interested in that because I don't wanna move fast. Okay. I'm gonna be good for it. I I actually agree with you because I think in the world of agents, like, if you move fast and break shit, you're just vibe coding everything, you're gonna drift way the fuck off by the Internet. Right? But the But you can start over with AI faster. Like, you can break shit a bunch of times. And then by on the tenth time, you can go back and rewrite your requirements. Time you were would have passed it to do by hand side. Right. Which is why instead if you if you take our sauce hand Not necessarily, though, because it depends on how think it depends on how our brains think. I I think it's race. Would What about your ad? Than that. Can break up into two flaming lip style. I don't know. Just just, like, see what we create. Like, And Oral like, groups with two different So there are people who just dive in. something like that. It's like a team red versus team blue situation. I don't want I don't wanna do we have to don't wanna compete. It's it's not yeah. There needs to be a couple of the I I remember a lot of, like, I lived in San Francisco, there's this thing called code for America. Uh-huh. I don't know if anybody parts they did in that at some point. Yeah. So, like, this feels a lot like that where the first part of the meeting is people come and pitch their ideas and then all if there's traction, people are gonna gravitate toward your idea. If there's no traction, you're gonna be by yourself after the pitch moment. So, like, it feels like a little bit of that. And then, of course, each group has to figure what methodology works for them. If it's like, in your case, doing mock ups and getting user stories or whatever the process is to get the what user wants. Yeah. But isn't part of I think in I'm not trying to speak on your behalf, Amy, but I I think part of what you're trying to say, is in a world of AI coding, the more research you do upfront to produce, like, a good spectrum sheet, a product requirement document, etcetera, You really narrow the guardrails you narrow the focus. Right? So you give it the accurate contact so then you're not just prototyping. You're you're building something that can be moved towards prod. That's one of the bigger mistakes that I think a lot of the the illusions that people have about vibe coding is that you can make something and just be able go to prod. And it's like, that's not true. Like, it I can spend two days on a product requirement document and get farther along in the first six hours of vibe coding or, like, using an AI agent Yeah. Then I can just be, like, what am I gonna do next? I don't know. Hey. Tell me what do you think I should do next. And then next thing you know, it's, like, drifted super far. However, there is such a thing as whatever planet is And I have a problem with this all the time. I will plan something to make procedure. Like, in every aspect of it, only to find out that I could change all of it because of how something ends up having to be built or realizing the partway through that there's, like, a facet that research didn't tell me that I would need to address. You know? And I spent all this time researching and and developing an approach to something that I end up throwing out the window anyway. You know? So I think but there's a heavy medium. Yeah. You know? Have to Yeah. Out of there. Yeah. Right. And, Rob We're probably largely in a in some level of agreement. I think we are. Yeah. Because I spend quite a bit of time doing interviews. And requirements. Yeah. Yeah. Even when it's fast. Robert, think what you suggested, though, is, like, hey. Is everyone cool with narrowing it down to saying, like, let's make an agent that evaluates your profile because the the profile has a fixed series of the units, questions. Right? We it does an assessment of it and then says, here are the questions that you could ask it or it might ask it you. To help you extract and and figure out how to hey. This is perfect. Copy paste this shit. Hit save. Like, you're good. You know what I mean? Like, it's not like you're chatting and then it's auto populating it into the system or mean, maybe that's later. So that I consideration. Right? Like, we don't it's user decides what to share. Right? Mhmm. This conversation is messy because we've eliminated the hierarchy. Right? No one is telling us what to do. And I think that's the beautiful part about it. So democracy is messy. Way Collaboration is messy. We all come from a different experience. I'll I'll share a little bit about of the things we're talking about is how long is this cycle? Right? There's this idea of, okay, we need to we need to think about what we're building. We need to build it. We need to reflect on what we built. Figure out, okay, you know, how should it be different? What's the next step? And then you do it The the question really is how long is the cycle? Right? And some of us feel feel comfortable with this cycle being an hour long, and some of us feel comfortable with this cycle being three months long. Right? And so gonna find and and this cycle exists sort of at all of these scales at once. And risk realistically. But that's the idea is that you you want to have cycles of deciding what to build, building it, and then reflecting on what you built and whether it meets the objectives or not. Essentially, you're testing hypotheses about whether something has to value it. Right? And then once you have that, you say, okay. From here, what is the most valuable thing we can build? Right? And so that's one way of looking at it. And and we're all gonna have the slice of A variety of experiences about how long this cycle up. So I guess I guess for me, I am still unclear about what we're building. You know, I I think when Ben is talking, I'm thinking, okay. Well, that makes it sound like somebody's already filled out some of their stuff. And I was thinking of something that occurs before that. Like, before anyone started. You know? So I think once we define specific along the same page about whatever it is that we're going and I'm not saying my thought on where we were going is the right one. I'm just saying once we're all on the same page, I say that's when we start. I I think the most flexible version of this is one that doesn't care how much you filled out the Yeah. If you filled out nothing, it has more questions for you. Right. Right. If you filled out a lot, maybe it's asking, like, or find questions. Trying to tell, hey. How can you ever fill it up to So, Cynthia, what is the average rate of new sign ups right now for white rash? Let's say we get a couple of weeks. Okay. So and how many an arranged, how many users do you already have? Or what members? In terms of member member members, we have upwards of easy. Okay. So so taking into consideration what you just said. The primary goal initially should be the enrichment. But if we design the enrichment of the existing 80 because then you're able to optimize features that you can build features that's off the top. Data optimization. Right? And it's all that kind of help new members to the software. Exactly. Mhmm. And it eats an optic. Like, a freak. Well, everything that it suggests is opt in. Yeah. Right. Think that's the Yeah. Right. It's and this is a hot 100 net orders. Maybe some of you have had in your work lives So it when I'm building products for Mayo, no AI generated rating content is ever the final content. It's presented as a draft, so it came in a beginning. Whether that's HR information, whether that's you know, innovation, documents, whatever it is that they're working on. That we're building systems for. That is the pattern that I think people feel comfortable with. People love the idea of AI helping out. They don't want AI to sign. Fair enough. Right? And so whenever we're know, I think these hashtags would be great for your interest or whatever. You know? I definitely want to okay those. Right? And I think most of us do. That should be an ethical principle that we agree to. I see a lot of knobs but, you know Yeah. For sure. I'm just agreeing that, like, we always ring it, but please Yeah. I could put in, and I saw And they're just looking at LinkedIn and whatever other profiles you have on the connection. So you haven't been out of Instagram and those are gonna be different spaces with different conversations of yourself. What is the I'm just thinking about the like, these are experience. But it's like a little bunny that pops up in the corner. Is this And then she pops up. Right? And you cook it, and then it has these questions. It says, hey. You know, let me know if you would like me to use your LinkedIn to suggest content for your whatever. And you can say yes or no. We're putting a yes or no. And then that gets you into having a conversation with them. And then they'll do the thing and say, hey. I got some suggestions, but I would like to ask you some questions. Is that alright? You know, start a thing? Yeah. Mean, I think it's cool. Yeah. But the reality of it is if if you set this upright, pretty much what should happen is if it's already there. It's like if the LinkedIn's already there, it's gone. Looked at it, it's created a summary of it. And then it's using that as context in the conversation with person. Right? Sure. And after the person has at some point somewhere on the page saying they agreed to him. So today I think that I think the flaw in the current system that would have to be updated in user interface is if they they would need to send out, like, an email notification, for example. That says, like, hey. We're just letting you know starting after this Friday, we're gonna use a we wanna use AI to enhance user profiles and to an assistant. But you cannot that. Well, either, a, you can opt out. B, you can edit. You can remove whatever you don't wanna have. But you you're you're right. There should be some type of opt out mechanic that's on it. But is the opt out mechanic a checkbox like you're opting out of it being scraped, or is it you opt out because you've removed it? You can imagine request. Right? Does it feel unethical if somebody's put their LinkedIn up as a public facing information on them I think for us to look at it. I don't mind that because my LinkedIn You know? So I put I know people are gonna look at it. Right. Think if they put it here Right. Is very Right. Yeah. Exactly. I think that's okay. Comments then I don't wanna go looking for it. Right. That's that's one thing. It's gonna say, what we should be doing is this or what we should consider is once you get it going, you do a batch run where you have an agent that goes out for each one of the URLs. Right? It writes a written summary that's based around the context just of the types of questions that we have available. Mhmm. Mhmm. So then it's it can see a bunch of other stuff, but if it's not your main it's not really doing anything with it. Right? Right. And then that becomes, like, an AI profile. Text. It's all Right. Right. That becomes like an AI profile. Like, it's your AI it's the white rabbit AI summary of your LinkedIn profile, and then that becomes one of the many different context files that it has available in its chat. So it's looking at your responses, but it's also recognizing hey. You've all these outside sources that could be data enrichment opportunities. So it can ask you questions, but also be like, hey, Rob. I noticed that, like, you actually score music and you have this you know, on your private website, have blah blah blah blah blah. That could be a really cool thing to add. You know? That's it. Yeah. Question, which is Mhmm. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Or That's a good And, yeah, yeah. weekends in pretty innocuous. But you may have other you know, other sources of information on you, and you don't really wanna publish it. We those people are there and That's a good example of how the agent could distinguish between the conversation with it, which is private. Like, if you say, hey. Here's my LinkedIn. I'm if you're talking to it, you're not putting it on your profile as Check my LinkedIn. Delete what you will from this, and let's continue to talk. Suggest things. And it'll soon It'll probably say, Do you wanna make LinkedIn one of your connections? And you can say no because that's principle that you decide. Yeah. It's not Adrian. That's what search. It'd be nice if you could upload a document too. Like, maybe what you were saying, like, a private bio that you We're just want them to reference but not use. Right. Resume. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So it's the Yeah. None of it is just put in your profile. It's just suggesting you improve Let's say it's your profile. Enhance Optimizer? Yeah. Optimizer. Yeah. Are we The tray stone contact I was gonna get an information. Everyone catalyst. So this is a Right. Profile. The profile of my know it optimizer? Is there a better word for that here? Profile optimizer agent. Are we considering at this point whether we keep it local, like, on a local server in private? Or do we use open source API? AI models? Or conversing with the AI? Like How can I say? Yeah. Just go for it. Whatever. Yeah. You're gonna have to you you can't really use an open source model the right way with web search tools. So they example that Rob gave earlier of or you gave earlier of, like, here's my LinkedIn. Go check it out. Like, you need a web search tool to do that. And I don't know if I don't know I'm not sure if Gemma, for example, how's web search? Yeah. So yeah. Just curious. That would be helpful. Is I make a new directory, which mod which is sort of model out there my you know, And let's say, let me go there, and then you can see I'm a bunch of projects. I'm gonna make a new directory Yeah. Actually, I I could either make a new one or I could take our infrastructure that we built before with little chatbots and agents and things and just start adding this as an agent within that. So I think that one was called Yeah. Like a morph. In North Dungeons and dragons Yeah. So we could you know, build on the infrastructure that we built before. We could start from scratch. Either way, what I usually do I'm gonna assume for a moment that we're starting from scratch. I'm just gonna say, say profile optimizes And I'm gonna go in there. And I'm going to make a new directory called user stories. I'm gonna go in there. So what I'd like to do is define a technical up. I'll just open this up here and start a And I can take the results of this conversation And just be like Okay. I usually organize it something like this. I mean, it's an active directory of And we slide out and say let's agents. You know, Or yeah. Or, you know, we could make it a same story that's just, like, trying to figure out you know, more about the projects. It's just a test. So one thing you could do is just drop in, okay, here's the project. Let's see. So I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna put this at the top. I'm going to say background. Yeah. I'm trying to get a context. Right? White rabbit, hatch hands, dot dot com. Okay. And okay. And let's say let's And then we've got some ethical principles. And we've got some nodes. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? You And then usually what I do is I will open something like cloud code. Right? And I guess the first thing I wanna do is initialize this And I can ask it, you know, can it make sense of what we wrote? And, you know, ask me clarifying questions. And this is a good way to get started. Just be like, what do you not understand about what I've said here? You know? Because, usually, I'm not I can't say for to the trees by this time. Right now. Yeah. I just a couple times today. Or I also I sent you the transcript from last week. Oh, not? And I could get it. Uh-huh? How did you get it? In granola. And I could send you everything we've talked to up till right now too. You wanna put that in as context.
